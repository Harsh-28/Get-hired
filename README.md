This project focuses on a system that predicts if a student would be placed or not based on the studentâ€™s qualifications, historical data, and experience. This predictor uses a machine-learning algorithm to give the result.
The project also predicts the recession criteria of an individual based on the company's name and the individual's designation following which the opportunities for growth and recovery can be identified.
